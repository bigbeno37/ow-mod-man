## How do I use this?

- Download the Outer Wilds Mod Manager installer [from the latest release](https://github.com/ow-mods/ow-mod-man/releases/latest);
- Run the downloaded .msi (you might need to ignore some Chrome / Windows warnings);
- Shortcuts are added to the desktop and start menu, use them to run the manager;
- Run the manager;
- Install OWML;
- Head to the "Get Mods" tab to install any mods you want;
- Press the top right play button to launch the game;
- You won't believe what happens next.

### The manager has encountered a fatal error, the system cannot find the file specified (Windows)

If you're getting an error message like this:

```txt
The manager encountered a fatal error when starting: Runtime(CreateWebview(WebView2Error(WindowsError(Error { code: 0x80070002, message: The system cannot find the file specified. }))))
```

This is a result of not having the [Microsoft Edge WebView2 Runtime](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/) installed. If you've used a "Window debloat" script, it's likely that this was removed, even though it's a *critical* component of Windows. To try and reinstall it, you can use the link above and download the evergreen bootstrapper.

The manager's installer is supposed to install Webview2 for you, but depending on how your debloating script works, it may have left rouge registry keys that make the manager think it's already installed. If you're still having issues, try inspecting the registry keys mentioned in [this Webview2 article](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/concepts/distribution#detect-if-a-suitable-webview2-runtime-is-already-installed) to see if they're pointing to bad folders.

## How do I use this on Linux?

Using the manager on Linux should be easy **proton and wine are not required**. The manager requires [Mono](https://www.mono-project.com) 6 to be installed and available on the PATH. If you're using the Flatpak, AUR, or Nix versions, Mono will be installed and set up automatically.

### What About Steam Deck?

The manager can be installed on Steam Deck in Desktop Mode in the Discover app.

Note that you won't be able to launch the game from the manager when in steam deck's game mode. But so long as you've *pressed* "Launch Game" at least once, you can launch the game directly and it will still be modded.

**You'll also need to change your controller layout to the "Mouse Only" template.**

## How do I uninstall it?

You can uninstall the Mod Manager by searching for "Add or remove programs" in the start menu (or in the control panel) and then finding "Outer Wilds Mod Manager" in the list. However, this won't uninstall your mods.

To revert the game to its original state, verify the game files' integrity:

- **Steam**: Library > Right-click Outer Wilds > Properties > Local Files > Verify integrity of game files.
- **Epic**: Library > Click three dots under Outer Wilds > Verify.

## How do I update it?

The manager will automatically check for updates when you launch it. If an update is available, you will be prompted to download it. On the Flatpak, AUR, and Nix versions, your system's package manager will handle updates.

## The game won't launch on Linux

Please ensure you have [Mono](https://www.mono-project.com/) installed and available on your PATH.

To debug issues with mono set the `MONO_LOG_LEVEL` variable to `debug`. and look at the logs.

On steam deck, keep in mind the game won't launch if you click Launch Game from the manager while in game mode. You need to launch the game directly from the steam deck's game mode.

### On Flatpak

Also, ensure the game is located in `~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Outer Wilds`, otherwise the manager won't be able to find the game as it only has access to that folder.

## I made a mod! How do I submit it?

The mod database is stored in a separate repository. [Go here to find out how to add your mod to the list](https://github.com/ow-mods/ow-mod-db#readme).
